CS4770 - Group 6 Read Me File

    What we have done so far for iteration 3 code wise is refactored the backend as a whole so that the 
mongodb version setup for us works with what we have done and so that our javascript is as asynchronous
as possible whereever possible to use ajax. There is still work to be done with the topology and logging. 
As for Documentation we have included a new iteration plan and new screenshots. Since our main focus was 
backend we have not updated usecases and domain model as they should still reflect what we have.

    All of the documentation can be found in their respective directoris in the docs directory found in
the same directory as this readme. Also, check the readme's in the sub directories as they are updated 
if there is not a visible change.

    Also, since we are having trouble figuring out why the connector lines for connections between 
networks are not displaying, i have provided a lone html file with the code for the network topology,
so as to demo how it works. It can be found in a folder titled demo within docs directory.
    
    The webpage can be viewed as requested at: sc-6.cs.mun.ca when you reach the login page you can login
with the preset login (user:NLSteveO password:pass or you can select the register button and register as
a new user(client or admin), however this will still access the same database and share networks and
clients with the preset. This however will be fixed in a future iteration.
